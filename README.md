# Java-Making-a-JDBC-Call
A code snippet example of how to make a JDBC call in Java

This code connects to a MySQL database, executes a select query on a table called mytable, and prints out the results. It uses a try-catch-finally block to handle any exceptions that may occur and ensures that the database resources are properly closed at the end of the program. Note that you will need to replace the database URL, username, and password with your own values.
